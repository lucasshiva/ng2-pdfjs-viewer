# Angular PDF viewer with Mozilla's PDF.js (v4.x) Viewer

A component for displaying pdfs, wrapping [Mozilla PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) version **4.7.76**.

It is also possible to display pdfs inline (embedded) or in a new tab.

The original project is [intbot/ng2-pdfjs-viewer](https://github.com/intbot/ng2-pdfjs-viewer), which is based on version 2.2.171 of [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js). It used the old event handling and aesthetics, which were no longer compatible with current versions of [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js).

This project is a fork of [kariudo/ng2-pdfjs-viewer](https://github.com/kariudo/ng2-pdfjs-viewer), a fork of [intbot/ng2-pdfjs-viewer](https://github.com/intbot/ng2-pdfjs-viewer) that updates [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) to v4.x.x.

## What's new?

1. **Updated to current version of PDF.js viewer** - Fixes a lot of rendering issues, improves eventing.
2. **New Events** - Added support for additional event bus activities (page rotation, document scale changes).
3. **Build Process Improvements** - Made it easier to modify this library and maintain changes with the examples.

## Installation

## Step 1: Install `@lucasshiva/ng2-pdfjs-viewer`

```bash
$ npm install @lucasshiva/ng2-pdfjs-viewer --save
```

And then configure it in your Angular `AppModule`:

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";

import { PdfJsViewerModule } from "@lucasshiva/ng2-pdfjs-viewer"; // <-- Import PdfJsViewerModule module

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    PdfJsViewerModule, // <-- Add to declarations
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Step 2: Copy task for pdfjs

For several advanced options to work, you need a copy of pdfjs from this npm package.
Edit your project's `angular.json` file and use `ng build` as described here https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config#assets-configuration

```json
"assets": [
  { "glob": "**/*", "input": "node_modules/ng2-pdfjs-viewer/pdfjs", "output": "/assets/pdfjs" },
]
```

_Please note, you must manually Copy `node_modules\ng2-pdfjs-viewer\pdfjs` to your `public` or `asset` folder or use any copy script as part of your build process. Another method could be to use `TransferWebpackPlugin` if you are using webpack(https://github.com/dkokorev90/transfer-webpack-plugin)._  
`TransferWebpackPlugin` Sample code

```typescript
var TransferWebpackPlugin = require('transfer-webpack-plugin');
...
plugins: [
  new TransferWebpackPlugin([
    { from: 'node_modules\ng2-pdfjs-viewer\pdfjs', to: path.join(__dirname, 'assets') }
  ])
]
```

_Please note if you decide to put `pdfjs` folder anywhere else other than the `assets` folder, make sure you also set `[viewerFolder]` property to help locate the folder._

**_Please note, copy step is mandatory to enjoy all of the different options listed above. You may also avoid this step and could directly use https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-pdf.js-in-a-website if you wish to just use the default viewer_**

## Usage

_For your convenience a sample app using angular is available under this repository, if you would like to see it in action (Folder SampleApp). It shows many ways to configure this component for different needs._

Once your PdfJsViewerComponent is imported you can use it in your Angular application like this:

```xml
<!-- You can now use your library component in app.component.html -->
<h1>
  {{title}}
</h1>
<ng2-pdfjs-viewer pdfSrc="your pdf file path"></ng2-pdfjs-viewer>
```

Here is a use case to download and open the pdf as byte array and open in new tab/window:
Please note, pdfSrc can be a Blob or Uint8Array as well
For [externalWindow]="true" to work, pop-ups needs to be enabled at browser level

```xml
<!-- your.component.html -->
<button (click)="openPdf();">Open Pdf</button>

<div style="width: 800px; height: 400px">
  <ng2-pdfjs-viewer
    #pdfViewerOnDemand
    [externalWindow]="true"
    [downloadFileName]="'mytestfile.pdf'"
    [openFile]="false"
    [viewBookmark]="false"
    [download]="false"></ng2-pdfjs-viewer>
</div>
<div>
<div style="width: 800px; height: 400px">
  <ng2-pdfjs-viewer #pdfViewerAutoLoad></ng2-pdfjs-viewer>
</div>
<div style="height: 600px">
  <ng2-pdfjs-viewer pdfSrc="gre_research_validity_data.pdf" viewerId="MyUniqueID" (onBeforePrint)="testBeforePrint()" (onAfterPrint)="testAfterPrint()" (onDocumentLoad)="testPagesLoaded($event)" (onPageChange)="testPageChange($event)">
  </ng2-pdfjs-viewer>
</div>
```

```typescript
<!-- your.component.ts-->
import { Component, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';
...

export class MyComponent implements OnInit {
  @ViewChild('pdfViewerOnDemand') pdfViewerOnDemand;
  @ViewChild('pdfViewerAutoLoad') pdfViewerAutoLoad;
  ...

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {
      let url = "api/document/getmypdf"; // Or your url
      this.downloadFile(url).subscribe(
          (res) => {
              this.pdfViewerAutoLoad.pdfSrc = res; // pdfSrc can be Blob or Uint8Array
              this.pdfViewerAutoLoad.refresh(); // Ask pdf viewer to load/refresh pdf
          }
      );
  }

  private downloadFile(url: string): any {
        return this.http.get(url, { responseType: 'blob' })
            .pipe(
                map((result: any) => {
                    return result;
                })
            );
    }

  public openPdf() {
    let url = "url to fetch pdf as byte array"; // E.g. http://localhost:3000/api/GetMyPdf
    // url can be local url or remote http request to an api/pdf file.
    // E.g: let url = "assets/pdf-sample.pdf";
    // E.g: https://github.com/intbot/ng2-pdfjs-viewer/tree/master/sampledoc/pdf-sample.pdf
    // E.g: http://localhost:3000/api/GetMyPdf
    // Please note, for remote urls to work, CORS should be enabled at the server. Read: https://enable-cors.org/server.html

    this.downloadFile(url).subscribe(
    (res) => {
        this.pdfViewerOnDemand.pdfSrc = res; // pdfSrc can be Blob or Uint8Array
        this.pdfViewerOnDemand.refresh(); // Ask pdf viewer to load/reresh pdf
      }
    );
  }
```

# Additional Information

Given below are examples of writing server apis(In aspnetcore c#) which returns pdfs as byte array. You can choose any server side technology as long as pdf is returned as byte array

Use case 1. As a RDLC local report viewer

```c#
[HttpGet]
[Route("MyReport")]
public IActionResult GetReport()
{
   // var reportObjectList1
   // var reportObjectList2
   var reportViewer = new ReportViewer {ProcessingMode = ProcessingMode.Local};
   reportViewer.LocalReport.ReportPath = "Reports/MyReport.rdlc";

   reportViewer.LocalReport.DataSources.Add(new ReportDataSource("NameOfDataSource1", reportObjectList1));
   reportViewer.LocalReport.DataSources.Add(new ReportDataSource("NameOfDataSource2", reportObjectList1));

   Warning[] warnings;
   string[] streamids;
   string mimeType;
   string encoding;
   string extension;

   var bytes = reportViewer.LocalReport.Render("application/pdf", null, out mimeType, out encoding, out extension, out streamids, out warnings);
   return File(bytes, "application/pdf")
}
```

Use case 2. Return a physical pdf from server

```c#
[HttpGet]
[Route("GetMyPdf")]
public IActionResult GetMyPdf()
{
   var stream = await {{__get_stream_here__}}
   return File(stream, "application/pdf")); // FileStreamResult

  // OR
  // var bytes = await {{__get_bytes_here__}}
  // return File(bytes, "application/pdf")
}

OR

[HttpGet]
[Route("GetMyPdf")]
public IActionResult GetMyPdf()
{
    var pdfPath = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "wwwroot/assets/pdfjs/web/gre_research_validity_data.pdf");
    byte[] bytes = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(pdfPath);
    return File(bytes, "application/pdf");
}
```

## E-Signature Support

Original issue -> PDF.JS is not able to load the signature in the pdf if that is done via the any **E-Signature** tool.

Resolution of the issue -> To support this feature need to comment/remove the below code from pdf.worker.js file and file path i.e. lib\pdfjs\build\pdf.worker.js

**Original issue code**

```javascript
if (data.fieldType === "Sig") {
  data.fieldValue = null;

  _this3.setFlags(_util.AnnotationFlag.HIDDEN);
}
```

**Resoultion code**

```javascript
if (data.fieldType === "Sig") {
  data.fieldValue = null;

  _this3.setFlags(_util.AnnotationFlag.HIDDEN); //remove or comment this line
}
```
